I was given recommendations for all supporting services and our photographers - led by Arnab - were really professional which is all I can ask for. The photos are awesome and these are great memories. Thanks team!",

I still remember my husband telling me back then, that he wants to still go ahead and book this team to capture our wedding ceremony and reception because he believed that Prithu and his team would do a good job with candid captures. We can say that it was one of the best decisions we agreed upon. When we received the pics that were taken,  we were awe struck. Every capture  reflected 'genuine' happiness, love and fun. Not many photographers can capture candid pics in its entirety, keeping the emotions of that moment  intact. Thank you so much Prithu and thanks to the Kalponic team, for capturing our precious Wedding moments so beautifully,  for us to cherish forever üëçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è",
